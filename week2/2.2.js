What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language standard used by several scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. It is a standardized specification for scripting languages, developed by Brendan Eich in 1997.
History
In the mid-1990s, Netscape Communications (the company behind the Netscape Navigator web browser) wanted to add scripting capabilities to their browser. They developed a language called Mocha, which was later renamed to JavaScript. Around the same time, Microsoft developed their own scripting language, JScript, for their Internet Explorer browser.
To avoid fragmentation and ensure compatibility between different browsers and platforms, the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) formed a technical committee (TC39) to standardize the scripting language. The result was ECMAScript, a standardized specification for scripting languages.
Key Features
ECMAScript provides a set of rules and guidelines for scripting languages, including:
Syntax: The syntax for writing scripts, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and objects.
Semantics: The meaning of the syntax, including how scripts are executed and what they can do.
Built-in objects: A set of built-in objects, such as Array, Date, Math, and String, that provide common functionality.
Error handling: Rules for handling errors and exceptions.
Relationship with JavaScript

JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard. In other words, JavaScript is a scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. This means that any code written in JavaScript is also valid ECMAScript code.

Versions
ECMAScript has undergone several revisions since its initial release in 1997. Some notable versions include:
ECMAScript 3 (ES3): Released in 1999, this version added support for regular expressions and exception handling.
ECMAScript 5 (ES5): Released in 2009, this version introduced strict mode, JSON support, and improved error handling.
ECMAScript 6 (ES6) / ECMAScript 2015: Released in 2015, this version introduced significant changes, including classes, promises, and async/await.
ECMAScript 2016 (ES7): Released in 2016, this version added support for exponentiation operator and Array.prototype.includes().
ECMAScript 2017 (ES8): Released in 2017, this version introduced async/await, Object.values(), and Object.entries().
ECMAScript 2018 (ES9): Released in 2018, this version added support for asynchronous iteration, Promise.prototype.finally(), and more.
In summary

ECMAScript is a standardized specification for scripting languages, which provides a set of rules and guidelines for writing scripts. JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.
